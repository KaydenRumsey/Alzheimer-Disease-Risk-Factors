# ðŸ§  Alzheimer's Disease Risk Factors â€” Capstone Project

## ðŸ“Š Dataset Summary

This project uses the [Alzheimerâ€™s Disease Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rabieelkharoua/alzheimers-disease-dataset) from Kaggle, which includes health, lifestyle, and cognitive data for **2,149 patients**. Each entry captures 35 variables such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, comorbid conditions, and behavioral assessments. The goal is to explore how these factors may relate to an Alzheimerâ€™s diagnosis.

- **Format:** CSV
- **Rows:** 2,149
- **Columns:** 35
- **Target Column:** `Diagnosis` (presence or absence of Alzheimerâ€™s disease)

## ðŸŽ¯ Why This Dataset?

This dataset was selected because it:
- Offers a well-structured and clean format suitable for in-depth analysis
- Includes a wide range of variables â€” medical, behavioral, and demographic
- Provides a strong foundation for exploring **early indicators** and **risk factors** related to Alzheimerâ€™s

## ðŸ§  Relevance to Real-World Problems

Alzheimerâ€™s disease impacts millions of individuals and families worldwide. Identifying patterns in patient data can help:
- Uncover **modifiable risk factors**
- Improve **early diagnosis**
- Inform **preventive health decisions** in clinical settings

## ðŸ§ª Project Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Standardize column types and values  
   - Check for outliers or invalid entries  
   - Ensure consistency in measurement scales

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Histograms, box plots, and summary statistics  
   - Correlation heatmaps and feature comparisons  

3. **In-Depth Analysis**  
   - Break down trends by Alzheimerâ€™s diagnosis  
   - Explore cognitive test scores vs. lifestyle factors  
   - Identify relationships among risk factors  

4. **Insights & Conclusions**  
   - Highlight meaningful trends  
   - Recommend areas for further study or investigation
